However, in my fifth semester, I decided to take CS111, an Intro to Computer Science course and ended up becoming more interested in learning programming. From there, I went on to puruse a Masters in CS, which I succesfully attained in May '20 at Kean University.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am passionate about learning new technologies and incorporating them in my personal projects. Aside from web development, I am also deeply interested in data science and user design. I believe that a minimalistic design paired with reliable functionality is the key to delivering a good product.
