            <br>
            <p>I am passionate about learning new technologies and incorporating them in my personal projects. Aside from web development, I am also deeply interested in data science and user design. I believe that a minimalistic design paired with reliable functionality is the key to delivering a good product. Please contact me at <a href = "mailto: byao.dev@gmail.com">byao.dev@gmail.com</a>, if you are interested in working with me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A team player, I am open to criticism from all disciplines, and not afraid to share ideas. I understand that criticism is a part of the design process and the ability to give and receive constructive feedback is important for improving designs and creating stronger solutions.</p>
